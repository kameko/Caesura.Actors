A simple actor system inspired by Akka.NET, designed to be simpler, easier to use, more predictable, less overly-engineered, and designed with plugins (AssemblyLoadContext) in mind.

Inter-process and inter-machine communication will be done after the core system is finished. This goal of this project is primarily to simplify Akka.NET and make it more targetable as an actor paradigm rather than a microservice framework.
